## Exercises

### Exercise 1

Remove this text, and add your answer for Exercise 1 here.

### Exercise 2

The answers for this exercise are given for you below. But you should
clean up some of the narrative so that it only includes what you want to
turn in.

First let’s plot the data in the dino dataset:

``` r
dino_data <- datasaurus_dozen %>%
  filter(dataset == "dino")

ggplot(data = dino_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point()
```

![](lab-01-hello-r_files/figure-gfm/plot-dino-1.png)<!-- -->

And next calculate the correlation between `x` and `y` in this dataset:

``` r
dino_data %>%
  summarize(r = cor(x, y))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 1
    ##         r
    ##     <dbl>
    ## 1 -0.0645

### Exercise 3

Add code and narrative as needed. Note that the R chunks are labeled
with `plot-star` and `cor-star` to provide spaces to place the code for
plotting and calculating the correlation coefficient. To finish, clean
up the narrative by removing these instructions.

I’m some filler text, you should replace me with more meaningful text…

### Exercise 4

Add code and narrative as needed. Note that two R chunks are given but
they are not labeled. Use the convention from above to name them
appropriately.

### Exercise 5

Add code and narrative as needed.

To add R chunks either type out the backticks, curly braces, and the
letter `r` or use the Insert chunk button above, green C+.

## Bonus Tips by Yoo Ri

Here are some helpful tips :)

- filter() is for extracting rows

- group_by() is for grouping datasets by assigned column

- ungroup() cancels the grouping

- summarize() is often used with group_by(). This function can print the
  output according to the group_by().

- facet_grid(y\~x,…) creates a grid with variable y as a row, variable x
  as a column  

- facet_wrap(x,… ) is useful when there is only one variable
